# How many members of the program committee have published a paper in a certain year? 

On this page, we will be able to see the percentage of program committee members who have published at least one paper in a given year.
Below, you will find a section for each conference, and within this section, there will be a pie chart for each year, indicating the percentage of members who have published a paper and the percentage of those who have not.

It should be taken into consideration that the data for the program committee is incomplete, as there are certain years for which it has not been possible to extract this information because the websites for some specific years are no longer available. The conferences affected by this issue are Middleware and SoCC, with missing data for the years 2012, 2013, 2015, and 2017 in Middleware, and 2012, 2013, and 2014 in SoCC.

Furthermore, this data is also not available for the EuroSys conference, as it was recently added to the study, and the data related to the program committee could not be extracted. We hope to address this in the future.

### Middleware

![Middleware 2018-2019](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Marina-LA/Study-of-Distributed-Systems-Conferences/master/img/CommitteeMiddleware/middleware2.PNG "Middleware 2018-2019")

![Middleware 2020-2021](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Marina-LA/Study-of-Distributed-Systems-Conferences/master/img/CommitteeMiddleware/middleware3.PNG "Middleware 2020-2021")

![Middleware 2022](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Marina-LA/Study-of-Distributed-Systems-Conferences/master/img/CommitteeMiddleware/middleware4.PNG "Middleware 2022")


We can see that the percentage of program committee members who have also published a paper in the same year tends to decrease in Middleware, with the last analyzed year supporting the lowest percentage compared to previous years.

### SoCC

![SoCC 2015-2016](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Marina-LA/Study-of-Distributed-Systems-Conferences/master/img/CommitteeSoCC/SoCC1.PNG "SoCC 2015-2016")

![SoCC 2017-2018](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Marina-LA/Study-of-Distributed-Systems-Conferences/master/img/CommitteeSoCC/SoCC2.PNG "SoCC 2017-2018")

![SoCC 2019-2020](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Marina-LA/Study-of-Distributed-Systems-Conferences/master/img/CommitteeSoCC/SoCC3.PNG "SoCC 2019-2020")

![SoCC 2021-2022](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Marina-LA/Study-of-Distributed-Systems-Conferences/master/img/CommitteeSoCC/SoCC4.PNG "SoCC 2021-2022")

We can see that the behavior of SoCC regarding the percentage of members publishing papers is similar to that of Middleware. It follows the same downward trend, with the last analyzed year, similarly to Middleware, being the lowest.

### Usenix NSDI

![NSDI 2014-2015](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Marina-LA/Study-of-Distributed-Systems-Conferences/master/img/CommitteeNSDI/nsdi2.PNG "NSDI 2014-2015")

![NSDI 2016-2017](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Marina-LA/Study-of-Distributed-Systems-Conferences/master/img/CommitteeNSDI/nsdi3.PNG "NSDI 2016-2017")

![NSDI 2018-2019](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Marina-LA/Study-of-Distributed-Systems-Conferences/master/img/CommitteeNSDI/nsdi4.PNG "NSDI 2018-2019")

![NSDI 2020-2021](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Marina-LA/Study-of-Distributed-Systems-Conferences/master/img/CommitteeNSDI/nsdi5.PNG "NSDI 2020-2021")

![NSDI 2022](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Marina-LA/Study-of-Distributed-Systems-Conferences/master/img/CommitteeNSDI/nsdi6.PNG "NSDI 2022")

For Usenix NSDI, we can see that apparently, the behavior seems to be the opposite of what occurs in the other two conferences. The percentage does not seem to trend downward, but rather, in recent years, it appears to be increasing. Not only that, but the average of the percentages found in this conference is higher than those found in the rest of the conferences.<br><br>

As a conclusion of this section, we can affirm that in the Usenix NSDI conference, a significant percentage of program committee members tend to publish at least one paper while serving on the committee. We can also state that in Middleware and SoCC, this percentage seems to be decreasing in recent years, whereas in Usenix NSDI, the opposite trend seems to occur.

# Diversity of countries in the program committee

For the program committee, not only has the number of members publishing papers while serving on the committee been studied, but also the diversity of countries to which the members belong. This allows us to understand the representation of countries in the three conferences. It is also worth noting that there are conferences from which all the data could not be extracted, resulting in some years not being analyzed. The following graphs aim to present these data in a straightforward manner.


### Middleware

![Middleware Committee](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Marina-LA/Study-of-Distributed-Systems-Conferences/master/img/gif/Committee%20Middleware.gif "Middleware Committee")

We can observe that in Middleware, there seems to be significant diversity in the countries to which the institutions of the program committee members belong. The committee is predominantly composed of members from European and American institutions, with the United States having the most members over the years. Similarly, we find representation from various Asian countries, and to a lesser extent, representation from Oceania. Unfortunately, with the data obtained, we do not find representation from the African continent.

### SoCC

![SoCC Committee](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Marina-LA/Study-of-Distributed-Systems-Conferences/master/img/gif/Committee%20SoCC.gif "SoCC Committee")

In SoCC, we can see that the vast majority of program committee members belong to U.S. institutions. The remaining members are from Asian and European institutions, as well as American institutions (excluding U.S. institutions). In this conference, unfortunately, with the data obtained, we do not find representation from either the Oceania or the African continent.

### Usenix NSDI

![NSDI Committee](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Marina-LA/Study-of-Distributed-Systems-Conferences/master/img/gif/Committee%20NSDI.gif "NSDI Committee")

In NSDI, similarly to SoCC, the majority of members belong to institutions from America, specifically from the United States, with very little representation from European or Asian institutions. In this conference, unfortunately, with the data obtained, we do not find representation from either the Oceania or the African continent.
