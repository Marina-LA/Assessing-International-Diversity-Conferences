The plot show above shows the international distribution of the Program Committee across all conferences, grouping the 11 years analyzed. As can be seen, conferences like NSDI, SIGCOMM, and SoCC are again predominantly North American, with Europe and Asia cumulatively representing only 20% to 30%. This data aligns with what we see in the [continent distribution of accepted papers]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ site.url }}{{ site.posts | where: "title", "Accepted Papers" | map: "url" | first }}) and the [diversity index]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ site.url }}{{ site.posts | where: "title", "Diversity Index" | map: "url" | first }}).

In contrast, conferences like Middleware and Euro-Par show a large European representation, with 50-70%. The other conferences appear to have a more balanced representation. It is apparent that the participation of Asian researchers in Program Committees are not yet in parity and are underrepresented with respect to their contributions, as seen in [coming tsunami of asian publications]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ site.url }}{{ site.posts | where: "title", "Coming Tsunami of Asian Publications" | map: "url" | first }}).
