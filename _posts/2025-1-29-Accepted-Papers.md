# Accepted Papers Continents

The image below illustrates the percentage of papers from each continent for the conferences studied over the past eleven years (2012-2023). As seen, some conferences exhibit greater diversity than others. ICDCS has a strong presence of Asian papers, though their presence remains limited in other conferences. CCGRID appears to have the widest representation, while NSDI, SIGCOMM, and SoCC are predominantly driven by North American participation. Additionally, the distribution of papers within North America is not equitable, as more than 90% of these papers originate from the United States. Middleware and Euro-Par, on the other hand, show greater European participation.
