description: In this section, all results related to countries are presented. These include both the number of countries that have participated in the different conferences, as well as the representation of continents in the conferences.

# Number of different countries per conference

![Number of Countries per Conference](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Marina-LA/Study-of-Distributed-Systems-Conferences/master/img/CountryBalls.jpg "Number of Countries per Conference")

In the figure above, the number of different countries that have appeared at least once in each conference is shown. We can observe a jump in the number of countries that have participated in Middleware, EuroSys, and SoCC compared to those that have participated in NSDI.

# Percentage of countries in each conference

The graphics displayed below show the percentages of different countries in the conferences, meaning the countries that appear most frequently in the various papers are represented by larger sections of the chart. Upon observation, it becomes apparent that not all the countries mentioned earlier as participants in each conference are visible, as many of them had such little representation compared to others that they were not perceptible. Therefore, these countries have all been grouped into a category called "others."

Despite having grouped different countries, we can observe a notable difference among the three conferences. While Middleware appears to have a great diversity of countries, as well as EuroSys, SoCC and NSDI seem to have a predominant country, the United States. This fact is easily noticeable, as we can see that even though the United States is also the most predominant country in Middleware and EuroSys, its representation does not exceed 40% in either of the two conferences, leaving room for other countries. In contrast, in SoCC and NSDI, the percentage of the United States is over 50%, approximately 57% in the case of SoCC and 65% in NSDI.

# Number of countries per each year

The following graphs represent the number of different countries present at each conference each year. The rectangular points displayed indicate what the value would be, taking into account that there are data points with a Null value. In other words, the points represent the maximum quantity of countries that could be present if the Null data points were considered as countries different from those already known.

## Middleware

We can see how this conference involves countries from 5 different continents. A significant number of European, American, and Asian institutions are present. We also find institutions from Oceania and Africa, although in smaller quantities.

## EuroSys

In this conference, although we can see how the United States has a significant representation in different years, we can also observe a substantial representation of other countries, mostly from Europe and Asia.

## SoCC

This conference yields similar results to Middleware, but considering that there are more institutions from the United States and, in general, fewer from Europe. We also find a significant number of Asian institutions, divided among China, Japan, South Korea, India, Taiwan, and Indonesia.

## Usenix NSDI

In this conference, we predominantly find institutions from the USA, with fewer from Asia and Europe. Unfortunately, the number of institutions from Oceania is very low, and based on the available data so far, there are no institutions from Africa.

# Percentage of different continents in each conference

The following table displays the representation of different continents at various conferences. The percentages have been calculated based on the number of institutions from each country that have been appearing at the conferences.

What can be observed is that Middleware and EuroSys seem to be the conferences with the highest representation, with Europe being the continent to which most institutions belong. Overall, in these conferences, representation from all five continents can be found.

On the other hand, SoCC and NSDI have America as the predominant continent, being significantly above the rest. Unfortunately, in NSDI, the representation of Oceania is very low when compared to the other conferences, while the African continent has no representation.

In conclusion, we could affirm that Middleware appears to be the conference with greater diversity, followed by EuroSys, SoCC, and finally, Usenix NSDI.
