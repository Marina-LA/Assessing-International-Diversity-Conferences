description: Discover how Asian research contributions in computer systems conferences have surged over the past decade, reshaping global publication trends. Explore the data behind this shift and its impact on European and American research presence.

In the field of computer systems, there has been a clear surge in research papers over the last decade. In particular, as shown in the images below, there has been a continuous increase in the proportion of papers from Asia, which also implies a proportionate (though not necessarily absolute) decline in European and American publications in many conferences. The images illustrate how pronounced the increase in Asian publications has been in most conferences, with peaks of 60% and 50% of papers in ICDCS and CCGRID in 2023, respectively, and around 30% in both NSDI and SIGCOMM in the same year. On the other hand, while both Americans and Europeans have seen a reduction in their proportions with the rise in Asian papers, we detected a more significant decrease in European papers in conferences like NSDI, SIGCOMM, SOCC, and EuroSys.
