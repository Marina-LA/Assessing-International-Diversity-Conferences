# Number of papers published per year

The following graph displays the number of papers published each year in various conferences. We can observe that it is not a stable value that remains consistent over the years; instead, it varies for each conference.

Regarding the number of papers each year per conference, it seems that Middleware and EuroSys are the ones that publish the highest number of papers in most years. Speaking in general, it appears that there is variability in the number of papers published in all conferences.

# Percentage of papers that have been written solely by U.S. institutions

The following graph will display the percentage of papers where all the authors belong to an institution in the United States.

![Number of Papers written only by USA](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Marina-LA/Study-of-Distributed-Systems-Conferences/master/img/Exclusively%20US%20authorship.png "Number of Papers written only by USA institutions")

Visibly in the graph, there is a clear difference between the analyzed conferences. On one hand, we find Middleware, where practically in no year do we find more than 30% of papers published solely by authors affiliated with US institutions. Similarly, EuroSys seems to remain within a range of between 20% and 40%, being slightly higher than Middleware.

On the other hand, we have Usenix NSDI, where in most years, more than 50% of papers have been published solely by authors affiliated with institutions in the United States. Between EuroSys and Usenix NSDI is SoCC, where the percentage is not as high as in Usenix NSDI, but it is also not as low as in EuroSys. We also note that it seems that in the last analyzed year, this percentage has decreased in three conferences, except for EuroSys. However, we cannot determine if this could be a trend, as there were no records available beyond the study period. Nevertheless, this decrease in the last year could indicate an increase in collaboration between countries when publishing papers.


# Percentage of countries in the different conferences

The following graphs aim to display the percentage of papers each year that include at least one institution from the specified country. The goal is to observe the participation of different countries in papers presented at various conferences.

### United States

For the United States, we can observe a notable difference in the percentages across different conferences. At first glance, we can see that the Middleware percentage is significantly lower compared to SoCC and NSDI, never surpassing 50%. On the other hand, SoCC and NSDI range between 60% and 80% in the case of SoCC, and from 70% to almost 90% in the case of Usenix NSDI. Therefore, we can affirm that nearly 75% of the papers published in NSDI are authored by institutions in the United States.

Similarly to the previous section, between Middleware and SoCC, we find EuroSys, where the percentage of papers with affiliations to US institutions seems to vary between 40% and 60%.

Therefore, it can be concluded that there is a notable difference in the participation of institutions from the United States in the various conferences, with a more prominent presence in SoCC and Usenix NSDI compared to Middleware and EuroSys.

### Canada

In the previous graph, we can see that the percentage of papers containing Canadian institutions is lower compared to those observed in the USA graph.
In general, most conferences have a percentage ranging from 0% to almost 15%. The conference with the highest percentage in practically most years is Middleware, maintaining a range between 10% and 15%. On the other hand, the conference with the lowest percentage is Usenix NSDI, varying from 0% to 5%.

### China

A noticeable trend observed in the graph is that the percentage appears to increase each year, regardless of the conference.
In this case, SoCC and NSDI are the conferences with a higher percentage of papers authored by Chinese institutions, reaching between 20% and 30% in recent years. In contrast, Middleware, although it appears that in the early analyzed years the percentage was higher than the other two conferences, in recent years it is lower, although it can be observed that it also tends to increase.
Once again, we find that EuroSys seems to be in an intermediate position, between Usenix NSDI and Middleware.

### HongKong

It appears that in most conferences, the number of institutions from Hong Kong participating in papers is lower compared to the countries observed earlier. Nevertheless, in the case of SoCC, it seems that this percentage is increasing, as evidenced in recent years.

### Korea

The percentage of Korean institutions appears to vary across the different conferences, and there doesn't seem to be a consistent pattern over the analyzed years. We can simply observe that this percentage seems to fluctuate from 0% to 10% for all conferences, and the only conference where this value has increased compared to the others is Middleware, in the year 2022.

### France

![France](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Marina-LA/Study-of-Distributed-Systems-Conferences/master/img/PercentageCountries/France.png)

At first glance, we can observe that the conference with the highest percentage of papers featuring French institutions is Middleware, followed by EuroSys, significantly surpassing the others. However, we can see that in the last three years, the percentage has decreased considerably, making it more equal among the three conferences.

### Germany

Similar to France, Middleware appears to be the conference with a higher percentage of papers written by German institutions, along with EuroSys. The values for these two conferences seem to be higher compared to the other conferences.

### United Kingdom

![UK](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Marina-LA/Study-of-Distributed-Systems-Conferences/master/img/PercentageCountries/UK.png)


In this graph, we can observe that SoCC and EuroSys appear to have higher values, while both Middleware and NSDI seem to have a slightly lower percentage.
