Below, the top 15 institutions that have appeared most frequently in various conferences are shown. To create the tables presented below, the institutions that have appeared in the most papers over the eleven years analyzed (2012-2022) have been considered. It should also be noted that in the case where an institution appears more than once in a paper, it is only counted once.

In each table, there is an entry for each institution. They are arranged from the most appearances to the least. Additionally, for each institution, the corresponding country is also indicated. It should be taken into consideration that research groups belonging to institutions are counted separately; in other words, they are not considered as part of the base institution.

What can be observed at a glance when looking at the tables is that Middleware seems to be more diverse than the other conferences, as the majority of institutions belong to different countries. On the other hand, SoCC and Usenix NSDI appear to be less diverse, as a large percentage of the most frequently appearing institutions are from the United States. EuroSys would be positioned at an intermediate point between Middleware and SoCC.
