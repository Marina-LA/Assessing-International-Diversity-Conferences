The graphs shown below have been created using the available data, excluding the 30% of citation data for which we lack information. For more details on this topic, see [obtained data]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ site.url }}{{ site.posts | where: "title", "Obtained Data" | map: "url" | first }}).

## What do we consider as citations?

We consider citations to include all articles, papers, books, and other works that have been cited by a conference paper, meaning an accepted paper. Therefore, when we refer to "citations of NSDI," we are talking about the articles, papers, books, etc., that have been cited by the papers published over the eleven years studied (2012-2023) in the NSDI conference.

## Analyzing the Results

We have also analyzed the international diversity of citations across different conferences, revealing distinct citation patterns. Less diverse conferences, such as NSDI and SIGCOMM, tend to cite mostly American papers, while more diverse conferences, like ICDCS and CCGRID, show a broader geographic distribution of citations, with a higher proportion of European and Asian papers being referenced.

It is not surprising that conferences with a strong presence of American researchers also cite American papers more frequently. The United States continues to lead in many research fields, which is reflected in the citation patterns of most conferences. However, American conferences generally have lower citation rates for non-American publications, often overlooking research from international conferences. In contrast, more globally diverse conferences are citing non-American papers at higher rates, indicating a broader recognition of research contributions from different regions.
