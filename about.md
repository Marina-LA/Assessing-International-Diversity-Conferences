# How we did it?

To obtain the data displayed on this website, a crawler was initially designed and programmed. This crawler utilizes [DBLP](https://dblp.org/db/conf/index.html?prefix=A) to gather information related to papers from each conference. We have also utilized the [OpenAlex](https://docs.openalex.org) API, which has allowed us to obtain all the information regarding the institutions of the authors of each paper.
<br>
You can find the GitHub repository of the crawler [here](https://github.com/Marina-LA/DBLP-Conference-Crawler). (*Currently, efforts are underway to enhance the crawler, aiming to obtain more data and ensure its reliability.*)<br><br>

> #### Attention: 
> It should be noted that the data is **not 100% reliable**, as there may be errors or incomplete information. Therefore, all results displayed are indicative. We apologize for any inconvenience.
